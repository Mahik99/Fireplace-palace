## Fireplace Palace ðŸªµðŸ”¥

# Description:

Fireplace Palace is a responsive mobile web page designed for a fictional fireplace company run by AI-generated clients, Mike and Mandy. This project was developed during a web engineering internship at School of Code. Initially built using semantic HTML and CSS, the project was later refactored into a React application, and eventually migrated to Next.js for better structure and performance.

## Key features include:

- A reviews section that fetches data from an API.
- A founders page created with Next.js routing.
- A hamburger menu for easy navigation.
- A design consultation booking page with form validation, ensuring smooth user interaction.
- Complex state management with the useReducer hook for form validation.
- End-to-end testing implemented using Playwright.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML/CSS: Semantic structure and design.
- React: Component-based architecture for reusable and maintainable code.
- Next.js: Improved performance and server-side rendering.
- API Integration: Used for fetching reviews.
- Vite: Streamlined development setup.
- Playwright: Automated end-to-end testing.

## Installation Instructions:
